# Stripe Verification Session Fix 🔧

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

### **Problem**
Users were getting the error: `"Verification session already exists"` when trying to create a new verification session, even when they should be able to start a new one.

### **Root Cause**
The API was being too restrictive in the `create-session` endpoint. It was preventing users from creating new verification sessions if they had any existing session with status `requires_input`.

### **Solution Applied**
Updated the API logic in `/src/app/api/stripe-identity/create-session/route.ts` to be more permissive:

**Before:**
```typescript
if (existingStatus.sessionId && existingStatus.status === 'requires_input') {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: 'Verification session already exists',
    sessionId: existingStatus.sessionId,
    status: 'pending'
  }, { status: 400 });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Allow creating new sessions even if there's an existing one
// This gives users the flexibility to restart verification if needed
if (existingStatus.sessionId && existingStatus.status === 'requires_input') {
  console.log('User has existing verification session, but allowing new session creation');
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Fix

1. **✅ User Flexibility** - Users can restart verification if they need to
2. **✅ Better UX** - No more blocking errors when users want to try again
3. **✅ Maintains Security** - Still prevents verified users from creating new sessions
4. **✅ Webhook Compatibility** - Works perfectly with the existing webhook system

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. **Test in Your Application**
1. Go to your My Account page
2. Click on the Verification tab
3. Try to start a verification session
4. You should no longer see the "Verification session already exists" error

### 2. **Test Multiple Sessions**
1. Start a verification session
2. Cancel or leave it incomplete
3. Try to start another verification session
4. It should work without errors

### 3. **Test Verified Users**
1. Complete a verification session
2. Try to start another one
3. You should see "User is already verified" (this is correct behavior)

## 🔍 Current Webhook Status

Based on the logs, your webhook system is working perfectly:
