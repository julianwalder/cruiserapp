# Prospect Access Fixes

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Issue: Prospects Had Inappropriate Access**

### **‚ùå Problem Identified:**

Prospects (users with PROSPECT role) had access to:
1. **Flight Logs** - Could view and create flight logs (should be restricted)
2. **Flight Logs Navigation** - Could see flight logs in sidebar (should be hidden)

**Note**: Fleet access was intentionally left available for prospects as it helps showcase available aircraft and encourages conversion to active users.

### **‚úÖ Fixes Implemented:**

#### **1. Frontend Access Control (Sidebar)**
**File**: `src/components/NewSidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**
- **Flight Logs Access**: Added `canAccessFlightLogs()` function excluding PROSPECT
- **Navigation Filtering**: Added flight logs to the filtering logic
- **Fleet Access**: Kept PROSPECT access for fleet viewing (business decision)

**Before:**
```typescript
const canAccessFleet = () => {
  return hasRole('SUPER_ADMIN') || hasRole('ADMIN') || hasRole('BASE_MANAGER') || 
         hasRole('PILOT') || hasRole('STUDENT') || hasRole('INSTRUCTOR') || hasRole('PROSPECT');
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const canAccessFleet = () => {
  return hasRole('SUPER_ADMIN') || hasRole('ADMIN') || hasRole('BASE_MANAGER') || 
         hasRole('PILOT') || hasRole('STUDENT') || hasRole('INSTRUCTOR') || hasRole('PROSPECT');
};

const canAccessFlightLogs = () => {
  return hasRole('SUPER_ADMIN') || hasRole('ADMIN') || hasRole('BASE_MANAGER') || 
         hasRole('PILOT') || hasRole('STUDENT') || hasRole('INSTRUCTOR');
};
```

#### **2. API Endpoint Security**
**File**: `src/app/api/flight-logs/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- **GET Method**: Added prospect check to block flight log viewing
- **POST Method**: Added prospect check to block flight log creation

**Added Code:**
```typescript
const isProspect = userRoles.includes('PROSPECT');

// Block prospects from accessing flight logs
if (isProspect) {
  console.log('‚ùå Prospect user attempted to access flight logs:', decoded.userId);
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Access denied. Flight logs are not available for prospect users.' 
  }, { status: 403 });
}
```

#### **3. Database RLS Policies**
**File**: `scripts/fix-flight-logs-prospect-access.sql`

**Changes:**
- **Updated SELECT Policy**: Excludes PROSPECT users from viewing flight logs
- **Updated INSERT Policy**: Excludes PROSPECT users from creating flight logs
- **Updated UPDATE Policy**: Excludes PROSPECT users from modifying flight logs

**New Policy Logic:**
```sql
-- Users with active roles (excluding PROSPECT) can see their own flight logs
(
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur 
        JOIN roles r ON ur."roleId" = r.id
        WHERE ur."userId" = auth.uid() 
        AND r.name NOT IN ('PROSPECT')
    )
    AND (
        "pilotId" = auth.uid()
        OR "instructorId" = auth.uid()
        OR "createdById" = auth.uid()
    )
)
```

### **üéØ Access Control Summary:**

| Feature | PROSPECT Access | Other Roles |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Flight Logs** | ‚ùå No Access | ‚úÖ Based on role |
| **Fleet Management** | ‚úÖ View Only | ‚úÖ Based on role |
| **Flight Logs API** | ‚ùå Blocked (403) | ‚úÖ Based on role |
| **Navigation** | ‚ùå Hidden (except Fleet) | ‚úÖ Based on role |

### **üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits:**

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Prospects only see what they need
2. **Data Protection**: Flight logs are protected from unauthorized access
3. **UI Consistency**: Navigation reflects actual permissions
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of access control
5. **Audit Trail**: All access attempts are logged

### **üìã Role-Based Access Matrix:**

| Role | Flight Logs | Fleet | Navigation |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| **SUPER_ADMIN** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ All Items |
| **ADMIN** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ All Items |
| **BASE_MANAGER** | ‚úÖ Own + Managed | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Based on Role |
| **INSTRUCTOR** | ‚úÖ Own + Student | ‚úÖ View Only | ‚úÖ Based on Role |
| **PILOT** | ‚úÖ Own Only | ‚úÖ View Only | ‚úÖ Based on Role |
| **STUDENT** | ‚úÖ Own Only | ‚úÖ View Only | ‚úÖ Based on Role |
| **PROSPECT** | ‚ùå No Access | ‚úÖ View Only | ‚úÖ Fleet Only |

### **üöÄ Implementation Steps:**

#### **1. Apply Database Fixes**
```sql
-- Execute scripts/fix-flight-logs-prospect-access.sql in Supabase
```

#### **2. Frontend Changes Applied**
- ‚úÖ Sidebar access control updated
- ‚úÖ Navigation filtering implemented
- ‚úÖ Role-based visibility enforced

#### **3. API Security Applied**
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint protected
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint protected
- ‚úÖ Proper error responses

### **üîç Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Prospects cannot see flight logs in navigation
- [ ] Prospects can access fleet management (view only)
- [ ] Prospects get 403 error when accessing flight logs API
- [ ] Other roles maintain appropriate access
- [ ] Admin users can still manage all data
- [ ] Error messages are clear and informative

### **üìû Support & Troubleshooting:**

#### **If Prospects Still See Flight Logs:**
1. Verify the SQL script was executed
2. Check browser cache and refresh
3. Verify user role assignment
4. Check API response for 403 errors

#### **If Prospects Cannot See Fleet:**
1. Verify user has PROSPECT role assigned
2. Check browser cache and refresh
3. Verify fleet access function includes PROSPECT

#### **If Other Users Lose Access:**
1. Verify role assignments in database
2. Check user_roles table
3. Review RLS policies
4. Test with different user accounts

## üéâ **Security Enhancement Complete!**

Prospects now have appropriate access restrictions:
- **Flight Logs**: Completely restricted (no viewing or creating)
- **Fleet Management**: View-only access (encourages conversion to active users)
- **Navigation**: Clean interface showing only relevant features

This balance ensures data security while providing prospects with a taste of what's available! üõ°Ô∏è
