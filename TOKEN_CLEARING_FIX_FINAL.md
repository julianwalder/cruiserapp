# Token Clearing Fix - Final Solution 🔧

## ✅ Root Cause Identified and Fixed

### **The Real Problem**
The issue was **NOT** in the `ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper` (that was already fixed), but in the **`FlightLogs.tsx` and `AirfieldsManagement.tsx` components**.

These components were making token refresh API calls, and when those calls failed (due to network issues, server problems, or other reasons), they were **automatically clearing the JWT token and redirecting users to login**.

### **The Broken Flow**
1. **User logs in successfully** → Token stored in localStorage and cookies ✅
2. **FlightLogs/AirfieldsManagement components load** → Make token refresh API calls
3. **Token refresh fails** (network issue, server error, etc.) → Components clear token ❌
4. **User gets redirected to login** → Even though they just logged in successfully

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### **Enhanced Token Clearing Logic in Multiple Components**

#### **1. FlightLogs.tsx**
**Before:**
```typescript
} else {
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
  localStorage.removeItem('userId');
  window.location.href = '/login';
  return null;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else {
  // Only clear token if it's a 401 (unauthorized) error
  if (response.status === 401) {
    console.log('🔍 FlightLogs - Token refresh failed with 401, clearing token');
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
    localStorage.removeItem('userId');
    window.location.href = '/login';
  } else {
    // For other errors (network, server errors), don't clear the token
    console.log('🔍 FlightLogs - Token refresh failed with status:', response.status, 'keeping token');
  }
  return null;
}
```

#### **2. AirfieldsManagement.tsx**
**Before:**
```typescript
} else {
  console.log('🔍 Token refresh failed, redirecting to login');
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
  localStorage.removeItem('userId');
  window.location.href = '/login';
  return null;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else {
  // Only clear token if it's a 401 (unauthorized) error
  if (response.status === 401) {
    console.log('🔍 AirfieldsManagement - Token refresh failed with 401, clearing token');
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
    localStorage.removeItem('userId');
    window.location.href = '/login';
  } else {
    // For other errors (network, server errors), don't clear the token
    console.log('🔍 AirfieldsManagement - Token refresh failed with status:', response.status, 'keeping token');
  }
  return null;
}
```

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

### **Before the Fix**
- ❌ **Any API failure** → Token cleared → User redirected to login
- ❌ **Network issues** → Token cleared → User redirected to login  
- ❌ **Server errors** → Token cleared → User redirected to login
- ❌ **Temporary outages** → Token cleared → User redirected to login

### **After the Fix**
- ✅ **401 Unauthorized** → Token cleared → User redirected to login (correct behavior)
- ✅ **Network issues** → Token kept → User stays logged in
- ✅ **Server errors** → Token kept → User stays logged in
- ✅ **Temporary outages** → Token kept → User stays logged in

## 🔍 **Why This Was Happening**

The `FlightLogs` and `AirfieldsManagement` components were making token refresh API calls as part of their initialization process. When these calls failed (which can happen for many reasons unrelated to authentication), the components were treating any failure as an authentication failure and clearing the token.

This created a race condition where:
1. User logs in successfully
2. Multiple components try to refresh tokens simultaneously
3. Some refresh calls fail (network, server issues)
4. Components clear the token
5. User gets redirected to login

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **Login Flow**: User logs in → Token stored → User stays logged in ✅
2. **Network Issues**: Temporary network problems → Token preserved → User stays logged in ✅
3. **Server Errors**: Server issues → Token preserved → User stays logged in ✅
4. **Token Expiration**: Actual token expiration (401) → Token cleared → User redirected to login ✅
5. **Announcement Bar**: Shows for unverified users, hidden for verified users ✅

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The fix is now complete. The application should:
- ✅ **Stop redirecting users to login** after successful authentication
- ✅ **Preserve tokens** during network/server issues
- ✅ **Only clear tokens** on actual authentication failures (401 errors)
- ✅ **Show announcement bar** with blue colors for unverified users
- ✅ **Hide announcement bar** for verified users

The user can now test the login flow and should experience a stable authentication experience without unexpected redirects.
