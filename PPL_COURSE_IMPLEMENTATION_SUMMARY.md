# PPL Course Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive PPL course management system that automatically detects and processes invoices containing PPL course items with tranche-based hour allocation. The system supports the complete workflow from student registration to course completion.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Services

#### PPL Course Service (`src/lib/ppl-course-service.ts`)
- **PPL Course Detection**: Automatically identifies invoices containing "Pregătire PPL(A) conform contract"
- **Tranche Parsing**: Supports multiple description formats:
  - `"tranșa 1 (2875 euro)"`
  - `"Tranșa 1/4"`
  - `"tranșa 1 din 4"`
  - `"tranșa final"`
  - `"ultima tranșa"`
- **Proportional Hour Allocation**: Each tranche gets proportional hours from the 45-hour course
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatically updates usage based on flight logs

### 2. Database Schema

#### PPL Course Tranches Table
- Complete table structure with proper relationships
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Process PPL Courses (`/api/smartbill/process-ppl-courses`)
- Processes all existing invoices to detect PPL courses
- Creates tranche records with proper hour allocation
- Handles errors gracefully

#### Update PPL Usage (`/api/smartbill/update-ppl-usage`)
- Updates PPL course usage based on flight logs
- Processes all users with PPL courses
- Maintains accurate hour tracking

### 4. User Interface Updates

#### Client Hours Component (`src/components/ClientHours.tsx`)
- **PPL Course Section**: New section in client details modal
- **Course Summary**: Shows total allocated, used, and remaining hours
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars and completion status
- **Tranche Details**: Individual tranche information with usage tracking
- **Student vs Pilot Distinction**: Clear separation between PPL courses and regular hour packages

### 5. Invoice Import Integration

#### Enhanced Invoice Import Service (`src/lib/invoice-import-service.ts`)
- Automatically detects PPL course invoices during import
- Creates tranche records immediately upon invoice import
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing invoices

### 6. Setup and Testing

#### Database Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-ppl-courses-direct.js`: Provides SQL setup instructions
- `scripts/test-ppl-setup.js`: Verifies database setup
- `scripts/setup-ppl-courses.sql`: Complete SQL schema

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects PPL course invoices by looking for specific patterns in invoice descriptions:
- `pregătire ppl`
- `ppl(a)`
- `ppl course`

### 2. Smart Tranche Parsing
Supports various tranche description formats commonly used in Romanian aviation invoices:
- Fractional format: `"Tranșa 1/4"`
- Romanian format: `"tranșa 1 din 4"`
- Amount format: `"tranșa 1 (2875 euro)"`
- Final tranche: `"tranșa final"`

### 3. Proportional Hour Allocation
- Each tranche gets proportional hours from the 45-hour course
- Final tranche receives remaining hours to ensure total equals 45
- Integer hour allocation (no fractional hours)

### 4. Real-time Usage Tracking
- Automatically updates usage based on flight logs
- Maintains accurate remaining hours per tranche
- Tracks course completion status

### 5. Student vs Pilot Workflow
- **Students**: Have PPL Course 45 Hours (tranche-based)
- **Pilots**: Have Hour Packages (regular flight hours)
- Clear visual distinction in the UI

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: 4-Tranche PPL Course
```
Invoice: "Pregătire PPL(A) conform contract - Tranșa 1/4"
Allocation:
- Tranche 1: 11 hours
- Tranche 2: 11 hours  
- Tranche 3: 11 hours
- Tranche 4: 12 hours (remaining to reach 45)
```

### Example 2: 3-Tranche PPL Course
```
Invoice: "Pregătire PPL(A) conform contract - Tranșa 1 din 3"
Allocation:
- Tranche 1: 15 hours
- Tranche 2: 15 hours
- Tranche 3: 15 hours
```

### Example 3: Final Tranche
```
Invoice: "Pregătire PPL(A) conform contract - Tranșa final"
Allocation:
- Final tranche: 45 hours (complete course)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script to get SQL instructions
node scripts/setup-ppl-courses-direct.js

# Copy the SQL output and run it in your Supabase SQL editor
# Then test the setup
node scripts/test-ppl-setup.js
```

### 2. Process Existing Invoices
```bash
# Process all existing invoices for PPL courses
curl -X POST /api/smartbill/process-ppl-courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Update Usage
```bash
# Update PPL course usage based on flight logs
curl -X POST /api/smartbill/update-ppl-usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## User Interface Features

### Client Hours Details Modal
The PPL course information is prominently displayed in the client details modal:

1. **PPL Course Summary**
   - Total allocated hours (45)
   - Used hours (from flight logs)
   - Remaining hours
   - Course progress percentage

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Visual progress bars
   - Completion status
   - Tranche completion count

3. **Tranche Details**
   - Individual tranche information
   - Hours allocated per tranche
   - Usage progress per tranche
   - Status (active/completed)

4. **Hour Packages Section**
   - Regular hour packages (for pilots)
   - Separate from PPL course hours

## Security and Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own PPL course data
- Admins can view all PPL course data
- Instructors can view PPL course data for their students

### Access Control
- PPL course processing requires ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN role
- Usage updates require ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN role
- Regular users can only view their own data

## Benefits

### 1. Automation
- No manual data entry required
- Automatic detection and processing of PPL course invoices
- Real-time usage updates

### 2. Accuracy
- Proportional hour allocation ensures total equals 45 hours
- Integer hour allocation prevents fractional hours
- Automatic usage tracking from flight logs

### 3. User Experience
- Clear visual distinction between students and pilots
- Comprehensive progress tracking
- Detailed tranche information

### 4. Scalability
- Handles multiple tranche formats
- Supports various invoice description patterns
- Extensible for future enhancements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automatic Role Upgrade**: Automatically upgrade STUDENT to PILOT when course completed
2. **Email Notifications**: Notify students and instructors of course progress
3. **Advanced Reporting**: PPL course completion reports and analytics
4. **SmartBill Integration**: Real-time processing via SmartBill API

## Conclusion

The PPL course management system is now fully implemented and ready for use. It provides a complete solution for managing student pilots through their PPL course journey, from initial registration to course completion, with automatic tranche-based hour allocation and real-time usage tracking.

The system is designed to be:
- **Automated**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Accurate**: Precise hour allocation and tracking
- **User-friendly**: Clear visual interface for all stakeholders
- **Secure**: Proper access controls and data protection
- **Scalable**: Ready for future enhancements and growth
