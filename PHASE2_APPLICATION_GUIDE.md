# Phase 2 Application Guide

## 🔧 **Login Issue Fixed**

The login 500 error has been temporarily fixed. The issue was caused by the login route trying to generate refresh tokens before the Phase 2 database schema was applied.

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Login now works without refresh tokens
- ✅ JWT tokens are generated successfully
- ⚠️ Refresh tokens are disabled until Phase 2 is applied

## 🚀 **Apply Phase 2 Scripts to Enable Full Features**

### **Step 1: Apply Write Policies**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/phase2-write-policies-fixed.sql`
4. Execute the script

### **Step 2: Apply Refresh Tokens**

1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/phase2-refresh-tokens.sql`
3. Execute the script

### **Step 3: Apply Role Management System**

1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/role-management-setup.sql`
3. Execute the script

### **Step 4: Verify Installation**

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
node scripts/test-phase2-security.js
```

### **Step 5: Test Login**

After applying the scripts, login will automatically include refresh tokens.

## 🔄 **What Changes After Phase 2**

### **Before Phase 2 (Current):**
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

### **After Phase 2:**
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "refreshToken": "refresh_token_here"
}
```

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits After Phase 2**

1. **Refresh Token System**: 30-day refresh tokens with rotation
2. **Write Policies**: Granular access control for all operational tables
3. **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke sessions immediately
4. **Session Management**: Track and manage user sessions
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of permission changes

## 📋 **Phase 2 Features**

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tokens will continue to work
2. **Automatic Migration**: New logins will use the refresh token system
3. **No Data Loss**: All existing data is preserved
4. **Gradual Rollout**: You can apply Phase 2 at any time

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Login Still Fails After Phase 2:**
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify all SQL scripts executed successfully
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### **If Refresh Tokens Don't Work:**
1. Verify `refresh_tokens` table exists
2. Check RLS policies are applied
3. Ensure functions are created successfully
4. Test with the provided test script

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Run the test script first
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Review the Supabase logs
4. Verify all SQL scripts executed without errors

The login system is now working and will be enhanced with full refresh token support once Phase 2 is applied! 🎉
