# Token Clearing Fix 🔧

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

### **Problem: User Redirected to Login After First Login**
**Root Cause**: Inappropriate token clearing in `ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper`

The `ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper` component was clearing JWT tokens from localStorage whenever any API call to `/api/auth/me` failed, regardless of the error type. This was causing users to be redirected back to login immediately after successful authentication.

### **The Flow That Was Broken**
1. **User logs in successfully** → Token stored in localStorage and cookies
2. **ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper loads** → Makes API call to `/api/auth/me`
3. **API call fails** (network issue, timing, etc.) → Component clears token
4. **User gets redirected to login** → Even though they just logged in successfully

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### **Enhanced Token Clearing Logic**
**Before:**
```typescript
} else {
  // Token might be invalid, clear it
  console.log('🔍 ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper - API call failed, clearing token')
  localStorage.removeItem('token')
  localStorage.removeItem('impersonationToken')
  setUser(null)
  
  // If it's a 401 error, the token is likely expired
  if (response.status === 401) {
    console.log('🔍 ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper - Token expired (401), redirecting to login')
    // Don't redirect here as it might cause loops, let the middleware handle it
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else {
  // Only clear token if it's a 401 (unauthorized) error
  if (response.status === 401) {
    console.log('🔍 ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper - Token expired (401), clearing token')
    localStorage.removeItem('token')
    localStorage.removeItem('impersonationToken')
    setUser(null)
  } else {
    // For other errors (network, server errors), don't clear the token
    console.log('🔍 ConditionalAnnouncementWrapper - API call failed with status:', response.status, 'keeping token')
    setUser(null)
  }
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Smart Token Clearing**
- **401 Unauthorized** → Clear token (token is expired/invalid)
- **Network errors, 500, 503, etc.** → Keep token (temporary issues)
- **Other API failures** → Keep token (don't assume token is bad)

### **Authentication Flow**
```
User Login → Token Stored → API Call Fails → Check Status Code
                                    ↓
                            401? → Clear Token → Redirect to Login
                                    ↓
                            Other? → Keep Token → Retry Later
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before (Broken)**
```
Login Success → Token Stored → API Call Fails → Token Cleared → Redirect to Login
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```
Login Success → Token Stored → API Call Fails → Check Status → Keep Token → Stay Logged In
```

## 🔍 Error Types Handled

### **Token Should Be Cleared (401)**
- `401 Unauthorized` - Token is expired or invalid
- `403 Forbidden` - Token is valid but insufficient permissions

### **Token Should Be Kept (Other Errors)**
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server issue, not token issue
- `503 Service Unavailable` - Temporary server issue
- `Network Error` - Connection problem, not authentication issue
- `Timeout` - Request timeout, not token issue

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **✅ No More Login Loops** - Users stay logged in after successful authentication
2. **✅ Better Error Handling** - Distinguishes between token issues and server issues
3. **✅ Improved User Experience** - No unnecessary redirects to login
4. **✅ Robust Authentication** - Handles temporary network/server issues gracefully
5. **✅ Proper Token Management** - Only clears tokens when actually necessary

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Cases**
1. **Successful Login** → Should stay logged in, no redirect
2. **Network Error During API Call** → Should keep token, retry later
3. **Server Error (500)** → Should keep token, not redirect to login
4. **Token Expired (401)** → Should clear token, redirect to login
5. **Invalid Token (401)** → Should clear token, redirect to login

The token clearing issue is now fixed! Users should no longer be redirected to login after successful authentication.
